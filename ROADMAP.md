## 🎯 Hackathon Win Strategy

### Unique Selling Points
1. **Real Passport Integration**: Actual NFC scanning (not just mock)
2. **Production-Ready**: Deployed contracts, working circuits, complete UI
3. **Privacy-First**: True zero-knowledge proofs, no data leakage
4. **Mobile-First**: Native mobile app with great UX
5. **Decentralized Governance**: Community-owned protocol

### Demo Highlights
1. Show mobile NFC scan (or simulation)
2. Generate multiple proof types (age, nationality)
3. Demonstrate on-chain verification
4. Show governance voting flow
5. Highlight privacy preservation

### Presentation Focus
- **Problem**: Current identity systems leak too much data
- **Solution**: ZK proofs + blockchain = privacy + trust
- **Market**: DeFi, DAOs, age-gated content, compliance
- **Tech**: Solana speed + Circom privacy = best of both
- **Traction**: Working product, deployed contracts, mobile app
